This repository introduces a method for performing text-based audio editing in your DAW. In brief, the steps are:

1. Set up your local environment
2. Run the script: it uses [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe the audio files and then converts the output .srt files into Audacity-compatible labels
3. Import the labels into your DAW

You can find more details in the video above.
